# Delegate Virtual PA Services website (kind of!)

This repo **was** going to contain the code for a business website for a friend, but is now going
to be used as a tech-test/tech-demo based on the principles of that website (the friend in question
was setting up their own business but is now in full-time employment again so doesn't require the
site).

The content has been heavily influenced (and in some cases borrowed wholesale) from other websites;
if you're *actually* looking for a Virtual PA, please have a look at those websites:

*Links above do **not** constitute recommendations, but recognise that other people's hard work has
been borrowed for the purposes of this demonstration site - if this site ever goes into production,
it **will** be with new and original content!*
