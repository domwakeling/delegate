In a [previous article](/articles/2021-11-08-whats-a-cms/) we found out what a CMS is, and found out that this *static* site uses NetlifyCMS to allow users to edit or add new articles.

NetlifyCMS should be *set up* by a 'technically proficient' user (for instance a web developer) but once it's available it offers a WYSIWYG-style editor with preview. The screenshot below shows what this experience looks like out-of-the-box.
