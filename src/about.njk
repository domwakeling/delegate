        <p>I'm Dom Wakeling, a web developer.</p>
        <p>Originally this website was intended to be a landing page/lead generator for a friend,
            but they started a different job and so I decided to use it to show what can be
            achieved on a static website.</p>
        <p>All the pages on this site are <i>pre-rendered</i> when the site is deployed to Netlify;
            that means that Netlify can store copies of the pages on servers across the world; and
            <b>that</b> means that anyone who visits the site, wherever they are in the world, gets
            to see the website super-fast without having to wait for it to load.</p>
        <p>Despite being pre-rendered, the site has a <a href="/contact">contact form</a>,
            a <a href="/payment">tip jar</a> (powered by Stripe), and authorised users can access a
            <a href="/articles/2021-11-09-netlifycms">web-based CMS</a> to edit or add new articles.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <h2 class="as-h3">TL;DR</h2>
            <p>This full-feature site is fast to load, cheap (in fact, free) to host, and easy to
                maintain.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>If you're interested in having a website built, please <a href="/contacts/">get in
